        <p>In my childhood, the books I liked most were series of Doraemon and Harry Potter, both full of fictions and marvellous fantasies. But there was another type I was also interested in, which is the story of scientific discoveries, and specifically, the story of theoretical physicists. What I did not realise is that MY TRUE INTEREST was on the process of reasoning, logicalising and philosophising. But not exactly the content of science.</p>
<p>In my teens, with good maths skills and interests on abstract theoies of physics, I grew fast on the tastes for physics and began to dream of being a physicist. And then I participated in CPhO(Chinese Physics Olympiad, derivative of The International Physics Olympiad). It was a memorable period. Although I didn’t get a high ranking.</p>
<p>It has to be claimed that I am quite a lazy person. Often thinking instead of doing, I like the style of reasoning or deducing but hate most parts of which combined with the experiments. All kinds of operating and I hate them all. Handicraft, Biology, especially operating with specific abstract knowledge and making experience links, such as Chemistry. That bothered me quite a lot.</p>
<p>And time passing by, with the period in College of Chemistry where my entire mentality had nearly been spoiled, I had to find another way of cheering myself up. It was then I astonishedly found my interests with physics were in fact the pursuit of reasoning, logicalising and philosophising. And it has nothing to do with physics itself although it contains lots of analogous ways of thinking indeed.</p>
<p>Then I realised that from the childhood and the very beginning of my life, it was to always my favorite to contemplate by oneself and to imagine the abstract and fiction rules in another world. I have never been attracted by the world but always fascinated by its latent patterns. So that I chose to be on the road of philosophy. To Develop sagacity and insight ,and look for some hints for who I am, and whom shall I become.</p>
